<h1>BEST PART</h1>
<p>College life is known as one of the most memorable years of one's life.<br/> It is entirely different from school life.<br/> College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not <br/>familiar with earlier.</p>
<p>College life experience is truly one of a kind. The most common memories <br/>people have of college life are definitely goofing around with friends.<br/> They remember how the group of friends walked around the college<br/> in style and playing silly pranks on each other.
Moreover, people always <br/>look back at the times spent in the college canteen. It was considered the <br/>hub of every student where they enjoyed eating and chatting away with their <br/>friends.</p>
<p>so in this small world of GVPCE i'm welcoming u to be a part of our tiny branch <br/>CSD,
where we gets to learn plenty of things and rectifies a lot more mistakes.</p>
